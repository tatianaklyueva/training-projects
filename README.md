|  Real estate market research |  The purpose of the research is to set parameters for automatic determination of the market value of real estate objects based on real data on apartments for sale from Yandex Real Estate service.  Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale: user input and automatically obtained cartographic data. Project includes data preparation, new metrics calculation and factor analysis based on pivot tables.  |  matplotlib.pyplot, pandas,  seaborn |   
| Tariff comparing for the telecom company  | The purpose of the research is to analyze the behavior of customers and choose, which tariff is better.   Clients of a mobile operator are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". This is a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers (500 clients). The data we obtained include client profile and territory information, tariff, and calls, message and internet usage info. |  matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, scipy.stats  | 
| Database analysis with SQL  | The purpose of the research is to analyze the company database while preparing a value proposition for a new product.  | pandas, sqlalchemy  | 
| Segmentation of mobile applications users | The purpose of the research is to study the behavior model of mobile application users. Research objectives: (1) evaluate the retention rate, conversion, time spent in the application and the frequency of use of the application by users, (2) segment users based on actions, (3) evaluate segment differences in user activity, (4) test the hypothesis of the relationship between conversion and retention and app install sources, (5) test the hypothesis about the relationship between the frequency of using the application and the day of the week (weekdays, weekends).| matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, scipy.stats, seaborn, sklearn |
| Churn analysis for the fitness club| The purpose of the research is to analyze and prepare recomendations for customer retention. Research objectives: (1) learn how to predict the probability of churn (for the next month) for each client; (2) identify main client clusters groups and their features; (3)  analyze the characteristics that affect churn; (3) develop recommendations for improving the customer relations (identify target customer groups;         suggest measures to reduce churn). | matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, seaborn, sklearn |
